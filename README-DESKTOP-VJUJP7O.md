# CHATBOT FOR UNIVERSITY WEBSITE  USING RASA 
A chatbot is a computer program that can communicate with people using artificial intelligence in messaging platforms. A chatbot takes input from the user and provides the corresponding response and saves both the input and the response for the future use. This project aims to implement online chatbot system to help people who browse university websites, using different deep learning techniques like NLP. In this piece of work the chatbot integrated with all the information that is useful to know fully about the respective website (College or University) and the chatbot is developed using RASA framework. The RASA framework is used to handle   students queries regarding the courses offered, Faculty details, Infrastructure, Sports arena etc. It is also integrated with voice assistant facility. We employ some of the neural network concepts in this piece of work as well as a common algorithm like Naive Bayes, which is good at evaluating how confident the chatbot is in its prediction. And also DIET(Dual Intent and Entity Transformer) classifier is used which performs both intent classification and entity recognition. The university chatbot educates future applicants about institution, programs, and courses. It explains the admission procedures, promote open days, university events, and provides deadlines for registering applications.
